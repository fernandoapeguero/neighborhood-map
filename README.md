# Udacity FEND Neighborhood Map Project
This app is to demonstrate the ability to use a js framework (`knockout.js`) & Google Maps API.
The application was made as a the penultimate final project for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.

## Code
CSS - Two files make up the CSS files that are local. Bootstrap CSS is CDN based and not local, just easier to update as it is currently using *Bootstrap 4 Alpha*. CSS files that are included are:
- `bootstrap-vertical-menu.css` (CSS for the Nav Sidebar)
- `mapStyles.css` (Overwrites Bootstrap CSS for custom styling of app)

JS - There are quiet a few here and I will try explain as best as possible without becoming too convoluted.
- `knockout-3.4.2.js` (Knockout framework)
- `app.js` (Main application file)
- `styles.js` (Contains the styles for the custom Google Maps look)
- `markers.js` (Contains myLocations to populate the map)

HTML - `Index.html` is where all the magic happens and all the data is binded.
